# Telegram Open Network lite client [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/poma/TON-CI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/poma/TON-CI)

This is a full unchanged TON lite node source from https://test.ton.org/download. This is a perfect starting point if you want to fork TON client and add custom features. Our bot checks upstream for updates every 5 min and commits any changes.

Also we have configured a public CI server (Travis) that builds ton client binaries for Mac, Linux, (Windows is coming soon), and a Docker container. 

## Download

You can download compiled binaries from [Releases](https://github.com/poma/ton-lite-client/releases) page.
